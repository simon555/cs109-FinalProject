## Important note ##

When you are developping in this repo, don't forget to :

- run `python setup.py install` or `python3 setup.py install` otherwise your imports will fail

- When you want to develop code follow these steps :

1- you want to add some code to the master branch

2- create your own separate branch

3- write your code

4- write tests to see if your code does not break itself / is consistent with previous code already in the master

5- merge your branch to the master

6- delete your own branch
