The .csv files have been excluded from the github repo.

You can downlowad them on the [Shared Drive here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PtTcA6SwPAAsfglZ8Dk_rHDP4aPpvzmw?usp=sharing_)

Then, you should put the downloaded files in the `./raw` folder, they won't be modified with the github operations

## Take care to what you download ## 
On the website, some files have two separate entries, for instance the AcceptedLoans.csv contains the regular inputs and the `Loans that do not meet the policy`. 
Make sure that this extra data is copy/pasted in another file.csv and remove these lines from the AcceptedLoans.csv
